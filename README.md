# ðŸŒŸ OIBSIP - Oasis Infobyte Internship Projects

This repository contains all the tasks completed during my internship with **Oasis Infobyte**. These projects cover a wide range of data science and machine learning problems such as classification, regression, spam detection, and deployment using tools like **Streamlit**, **Scikit-Learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **Matplotlib**.
